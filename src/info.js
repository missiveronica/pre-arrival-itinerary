        description: "Watsu is a form of water therapy, which is also called hydrotherapy. It involves stretches, massages, and acupressure in warm water. The term Watsu comes from the words “water” and “shiatsu.” Shiatsu is a type of traditional Japanese massage that uses acupressure to promote relaxation. In Japanese, shiatsu means “finger pressure.” During Watsu, a therapist gently moves your body in water. This is known as passive hydrotherapy, because you don’t need to actively perform the movements.",
